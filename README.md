DAS Group 27 project 2ï¼šDeterminants of High Income: A Generalized Linear Model Analysis of 1994 US Census Socioeconomic Factors

Project objectives:
Based on census data, a generalized linear model (GLM) was used to analyze the key factors that affect whether an individual's annual income exceeds $50k.

Data set:
File : 'dataset27.csv'
Variable Description :
'Income' : target variable (binary: >50k or <=50k)
'Age', 'Education', 'Occupation', etc. : predictors

Analysis process and contribution:
1. Data cleaning: dealing with missing values and outliers (see 'datasets'). (Huiyang Liao is mainly responsible)
2. Exploratory analysis: Visualization of the relationship between income distribution and variables(see 'scripts' - 'EDA'). (Yizhou Gu is mainly responsible)
3. Modeling: Logistic regression model construction and optimization (see 'scripts' - 'model fitting'). (Mengting Zhou is mainly responsible)
4. Results  : Summary of significant factors and Policy recommendations (see 'results').
5. PPT making and presentation. (Qiwei Wang & Mohan Wang are mainly responsible)
